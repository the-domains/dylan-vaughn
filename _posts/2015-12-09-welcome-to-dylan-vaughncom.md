**Dear Friends, **

Welcome to www.dylanvaughn.com.!
I am so happy to present a wide selection of my music for the first time on the web. Please, wear headphones and crank it up!
I have also included projects, photographs from recent travels to China, Tibet, Nepal, and Egypt, sketches and drawings, a short music bio and a music CV.
I would love to hear from you, so please drop me a line!
Wishing you health and happiness always,

Dylan
